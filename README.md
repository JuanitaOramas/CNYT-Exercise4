##  PRIMER SISTEMA CUÁNTICO DESCRITO EN LA SECCIÓN 4.1.

Exercise 4.3.1 Find all the possible states the system described in Exercise 4.2.2 can transition into after a measurement has been carried out.

Exercise 4.3.2 Perform the same calculations as in the last example, using Exercise 4.3.1. Then draw the probability distribution of the eigenvalues as in the previous
example.

Exercise 4.4.1 Verify that are unitary matrices. Multiply them and verify that their product is also unitary.

Exercise 4.4.2 Go back to Example 3.3.2 (quantum billiard ball), keep the same initial state vector [1, 0, 0, 0]T, but change the unitary map to


##  Discusion 

4.5.2 Taking into account that the tensor product is associative , it can be inferred that each one of the vectors V will represent a system of several tensor products among themselves , for which following the postulate , the set of complexes is taken and its probability is sought in a given specific point:

being m = n =4 with complexes Co,o=...=C3.3=1+i , we look for the particle at point X1:


4.5.3 Then we check what is the probability of finding a particle of position x1 and another particle in a position y1 :


In probabilistic terms, this quantity is large enough with a value of 62.5% that both particles are in these two positions.
