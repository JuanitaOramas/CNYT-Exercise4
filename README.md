##  PRIMER SISTEMA CUÁNTICO DESCRITO EN LA SECCIÓN 4.1.

Exercise 4.3.1 Find all the possible states the system described in Exercise 4.2.2 can transition into after a measurement has been carried out.

Exercise 4.3.2 Perform the same calculations as in the last example, using Exercise 4.3.1. Then draw the probability distribution of the eigenvalues as in the previous
example.

Exercise 4.4.1 Verify that are unitary matrices. Multiply them and verify that their product is also unitary.

Exercise 4.4.2 Go back to Example 3.3.2 (quantum billiard ball), keep the same initial state vector [1, 0, 0, 0]T, but change the unitary map to
