4.5.2 Taking into account that the tensor product is associative , it can be inferred that each one of the vectors V will represent a system of several tensor products among themselves , for which following the postulate , the set of complexes is taken and its probability is sought in a given specific point:

being m = n =4 with complexes Co,o=...=C3.3=1+i , we look for the particle at point X1:


4.5.3 Then we check what is the probability of finding a particle of position x1 and another particle in a position y1 :


In probabilistic terms, this quantity is large enough with a value of 62.5% that both particles are in these two positions.
