4.5.2 and 4.5.3
Taking into account that the tensor product is associative , it can be inferred that each one of the vectors V will represent a system of several tensor products among themselves , for which following the postulate , the set of complexes is taken and its probability is sought in a given specific point:

being m = n = 3 with complexes Co,o=...=C3.3=1+i , we look for the particle at point X1:
([ [[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]],[[1,1]]])
We find square modulus to each of the complex numbers of the vector

Then we check what is the probability of finding a particle of position x1 and another particle in a position y1.With the position x1 and y1 we proceed to calculate the probability by dividing it under the sum of all the complexes of the vector previously.
In this case 0.0425

In probabilistic terms, this quantity is large enough with a value of 42.5% that both particles are in these two positions.
